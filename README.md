# filenames
Small programs to manipulate filenames

* bicapitalize.pl -- BiCapitalizes filenames containing spaces and underscores. 
* respace.pl -- puts back spaces (actually underscores) into BiCapitalized filenames. 
* respacefilter.pl -- puts back spaces into BiCapitalized strings. Works as filter for pipes, or takes a string as argument.
* lowercase.pl -- lowercases filenames in the current directory.
